# Dynamic Spring

At an arbitrary moment in time, the spring begins to be affected by the force that
compresses it. 
At any time, the force of the impact can be removed. Then the spring will begin
to gradually unclench (also according to the exponential law).
Set parameters: impact force, maximum compression ratio of the spring
Model controls: compress spring, release spring, maximum
spring length
Visualized values: the length of the spring, the time since the start of the simulation.

Dynamic process

After entering the data and compressing the spring, 
we release it and watch how the Progressbar oscillates according to Hooke's law.
Also, with the help of Jspinner, you can speed up or slow down the fluctuations.
